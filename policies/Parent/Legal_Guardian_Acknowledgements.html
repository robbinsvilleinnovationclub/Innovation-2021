As the parent/guardian I will support my child’s participation by:
• Making arrangements so my child is able to attend and sign-in on time and be prepared; this includes avoiding scheduling appointments during the program so that I can monitor their activity.
• Allowing time at home for my child to complete required assignments or activities.
• Communicating with staff prior to program start time if my child must be absent.
• Not making inappropriate requests of staff that conflict with program guidelines.
• Working together with program staff to resolve issues that arise with my child.
• Reporting illegal or inappropriate online behavior by staff or other program participants to program coordinators.
