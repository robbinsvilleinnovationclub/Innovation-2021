Media and Communication Policy 
 
Media and Communication Policy Rutgers University routinely promotes programs involving minors through various media, including but not limited to newsletters, newspapers, brochures, and displays. In doing so, the names photos, and videos of members may be included to help tell the story. I understand that this Program is conducted in an online/virtual environment and electronic communications will be necessary. The program coordinator(s) agree that such communications will be focused on topics related to the Program activities, no private communications will occur with youth participants, and a minimum of two (2) program staff will be included on all communications.

 Yes, I authorize Rutgers University to use my picture and/or name in program promotions as outlined above.
 No, do not use my individual picture for any purpose. I will make an effort to avoid opportunities to be in group photos.
 No, do not use my name for any purpose
